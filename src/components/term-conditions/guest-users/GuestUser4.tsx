      <h3>4. MOTORCYCLES AND SUPER-BIKE RENTAL SERVICES</h3>
      <p>
        The contract will be concluded between the User who has booked the
        motorcycle, electric bike, or superbike rental and the third-party
        service provider who has listed their rental services on this Platform.{' '}
        <br />
        <br />
        Under no circumstances will the contract be considered between the User
        and us, nor will we be under any obligation or liability &#40;directly
        or indirectly&#41; for the service provided by such third-party service
        provider. <br />
        <br /> For the motorcycle, electric bike, and superbike rental section,
        once a user expresses interest in connecting with third-party agents,
        the user is entitled to request rental services directly from the
        supplier. Any further claims or service-related matters should be
        addressed directly with the supplier/agent. Payment and discussions
        regarding the terms of rent and other conditions are to be confirmed
        directly with the agent. <br />
        <br /> During the rental period, all users are required to comply with
        the applicable laws as per the local Transport Authority. Any
        instructions given by the agent or relevant authorities must be adhered
        to. Users are prohibited from performing dangerous stunts, riding on
        restricted paths, or using motorcycles, electric bikes, or superbikes in
        a manner that could endanger themselves or others. <br />
        <br /> If a user violates these rules, they will be liable for any
        damages to the vehicle, compensation for any business loss due to the
        vehicle&apos;s downtime, and any fines or penalties imposed by the UAE
        authorities. Consumption of food while riding is discouraged, and the
        use of alcohol is strictly forbidden. <br />
        <br /> In special situations, such as extreme weather conditions,
        compensation is limited. Users must accept the possibility of longer
        waiting periods or last-minute cancellations under these circumstances.{' '}
        <br />
        <br />
        The images of motorcycles, electric bikes, and superbikes shown on the
        Platform are only suggested examples. Actual models may vary from the
        booked vehicle. All vehicles are as per local specifications and subject
        to availability. An upgrade might be offered if the booked class of
        vehicle is not available by the agent at the time. <br />
        <br /> Users renting a motorcycle, electric bike, or superbike must
        present valid documentation. For UAE residents, this includes a UAE
        driving license, Emirates ID, and any other relevant documents. For
        non-UAE residents, an International Driving Permit or GCC driving
        license is required. All documentation must be in the User&apos;s name.
        Users are responsible for ensuring that the provided documents are
        accurate, valid, and current.
