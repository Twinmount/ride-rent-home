        Under no circumstances shall Ride.Rent or its suppliers be liable for
        any damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of data,
        loss of profits, or business interruption, resulting from the use or
        inability to use the materials on the Ride.Rent website. This limitation
        of liability applies even if Ride.Rent or an authorized representative

          a. Offers and Price Adjustments by Agents and Suppliers
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Ride.Rent acts as a neutral digital platform facilitating connections
          between independent vehicle suppliers and users seeking rental
          services. We do not own, operate, manage, or control any of the
          vehicles listed on our platform. All vehicles and related services are
          exclusively provided by third-party suppliers or their authorized
          agents.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Any discounts, promotional offers, or pricing adjustments communicated
          through the platform or outside the platform are determined solely at
          the discretion of the respective suppliers or their representatives.
          Ride.Rent does monitor price inflations and advise suppliers to
          provide services at market standards but we do not influence,
          regulate, or guarantee the pricing policies, availability, or terms
          offered by these suppliers. Users are advised that pricing may
          fluctuate due to factors such as vehicle availability, seasonal
          demand, or individual supplier policies.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          It remains the responsibility of each user to confirm all pricing
          details, including applicable taxes, fees, and additional charges,
          directly with the supplier prior to finalizing a booking. Ride.Rent
          strongly recommends reviewing the supplier&apos;s terms and conditions
          to ensure clarity on all charges and policies.

          Ride.Rent operates solely as a digital marketplace facilitating the
          discovery and booking of vehicle rentals between independent suppliers

          rental agreements. All rental agreements are formed directly between

          While Ride.Rent provides tools for users to communicate with
          suppliers, we do not control the frequency, quality, or timing of
          responses from suppliers. Users must understand that suppliers operate
          independently and may have varied response times based on their
          business practices.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Although we monitor communication channels for inappropriate or
          offensive content, such measures are limited in scope. Ride.Rent
          disclaims all responsibility for any misleading information, offensive
          remarks, or invalid offers communicated by suppliers through the

        <p className="mb-4">
          Users are strongly discouraged from making any cash payments or
          monetary transfers to suppliers before physically inspecting the
          vehicle or availing of the rental service. Ride.Rent does not mediate
          financial transactions outside its platform and shall not be held
          responsible for any monetary loss, fraud, or service failure resulting

          All price negotiations and bargains conducted between users and
          suppliers occur outside the scope of Ride.Rent&apos;s operations. The
          platform does not guarantee the stability or accuracy of listed
          prices, and users should confirm final pricing directly with suppliers
          before booking.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Any price mismatches, hidden charges, or post-booking adjustments are

          Suppliers may provide vehicle models or variants different from those
          displayed on the platform due to availability or other operational
          reasons. Ride.Rent encourages users to verify the exact make, model,
          and specifications of the vehicle with the supplier prior to
          completing their booking.

          All rental vehicles listed on Ride.Rent are reported covered, if

          Ride.Rent does not issue or validate insurance coverage and cannot be
          held responsible for any deficiencies, exclusions, or disputes related
          to insurance claims. Users should confirm the extent of insurance
