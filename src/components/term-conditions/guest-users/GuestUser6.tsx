      <h3>6. CHARTERS &#40;HELICOPTERS AND AIRCRAFT&#41; RENTAL SERVICES</h3>
      <p>
        The contract will be concluded between the User who has booked the
        charter (helicopter or aircraft) rental and the third-party service
        provider who has listed their rental services on this Platform. <br />
        <br /> Under no circumstances will the contract be considered between
        the User and us, nor will we be under any obligation or liability
        (directly or indirectly) for the service provided by such third-party
        service provider. <br />
        <br /> For the charter (helicopter and aircraft) rental section, once a
        user expresses interest in connecting with third-party agents, the user
        is entitled to request rental services directly from the supplier. Any
        further claims or service-related matters should be addressed directly
        with the supplier/agent. Payment and discussions regarding the terms of
        rent and other conditions are to be confirmed directly with the agent.{' '}
        <br />
        <br />
        During the rental period, all users are required to comply with the
        applicable laws as per the local Aviation Authority. Any instructions
        given by the agent, pilot, or relevant authorities must be adhered to.
        Users are prohibited from engaging in dangerous activities, tampering
        with aircraft equipment, or behaving in a manner that could endanger
        themselves or others. <br />
        <br /> If a user violates these rules, they will be liable for any
        damages to the aircraft, compensation for any business loss due to the
        aircraft&apos;s downtime, and any fines or penalties imposed by the UAE
        authorities. Consumption of food and beverages is subject to the
        regulations of the aircraft operator, and the use of alcohol is subject
        to local laws and the discretion of the pilot. <br />
        <br /> In special situations, such as extreme weather conditions or
        aviation emergencies, compensation is limited. Users must accept the
        possibility of longer waiting periods or last-minute cancellations under
        these circumstances. <br />
        <br /> The images of helicopters and aircraft shown on the Platform are
        only suggested examples. Actual models may vary from the booked
        aircraft. All aircraft are as per local specifications and subject to
        availability. An upgrade might be offered if the booked class of
        aircraft is not available by the agent at the time. <br />
        <br /> Users renting a charter (helicopter or aircraft) must present
        valid documentation. For UAE residents, this includes an Emirates ID and
        any other relevant documents. For non-UAE residents, a passport or other
        identification documents are required. All documentation must be in the
        User&apos;s name. Users are responsible for ensuring that the provided
        documents are accurate, valid, and current. Failure to inform the
        supplier about the cancellation or a no-show will result in no refund.
