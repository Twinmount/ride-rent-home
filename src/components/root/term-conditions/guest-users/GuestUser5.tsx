      <h3>5. LEISURE BOATS AND YACHTS RENTAL SERVICES</h3>
      <p>
        The contract will be concluded between the User who has booked the
        leisure boat or yacht rental and the third-party service provider who
        has listed their rental services on this Platform. <br />
        <br /> Under no circumstances will the contract be considered between
        the User and us, nor will we be under any obligation or liability
        &#40;directly or indirectly&#41; for the service provided by such
        third-party service provider. <br />
        <br /> For the leisure boat and yacht rental section, once a user
        expresses interest in connecting with third-party agents, the user is
        entitled to request rental services directly from the supplier. Any
        further claims or service-related matters should be addressed directly
        with the supplier/agent. Payment and discussions regarding the terms of
        rent and other conditions are to be confirmed directly with the agent.{' '}
        <br />
        <br />
        During the rental period, all users are required to comply with the
        applicable laws as per the local Transport Authority. Any instructions
        given by the agent, captain, or relevant authorities must be adhered to.
        Users are prohibited from engaging in dangerous activities, throwing
        objects overboard, or behaving in a manner that could endanger
        themselves or others. <br />
        <br />
        If a user violates these rules, they will be liable for any damages to
        the vessel, compensation for any business loss due to the vessel&apos;s
        downtime, and any fines or penalties imposed by the UAE authorities.
        Consumption of food is allowed but should be managed responsibly, and
        the use of alcohol is subject to local laws and the discretion of the
        captain. <br />
        <br /> In special situations, such as extreme weather conditions or
        maritime emergencies, compensation is limited. Users must accept the
        possibility of longer waiting periods or last-minute cancellations under
        these circumstances. <br />
        <br /> The images of leisure boats and yachts shown on the Platform are
        only suggested examples. Actual models may vary from the booked vessel.
        All vessels are as per local specifications and subject to availability.
        An upgrade might be offered if the booked class of vessel is not
        available by the agent at the time. <br />
        <br /> Users renting a leisure boat or yacht must present valid
        documentation. For UAE residents, this includes an Emirates ID and any
        other relevant documents. For non-UAE residents, a passport or other
        identification documents are required. All documentation must be in the
        User&apos;s name. Users are responsible for ensuring that the provided
        documents are accurate, valid, and current.
