        <h3>8. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES, REDEMPTION & REFUNDS</h3>
        <p>
          On our platform &#40;Ride.Rent and our partner site MyFleet.rent&#41;, we
          provide an online platform to promote third-party businesses. To create
          a listing, you must register on the platform using a valid email address
          and password. Once the free trial &#40;if applicable&#41; expires, you need to
          purchase a subscription plan of your choice. We act as intermediaries,
          not as buyers or service providers, facilitating a space for service
          providers and customers to connect online, negotiate, and complete
          transactions. <br />
          <br /> This means that in addition to this agreement, you will enter
          into other contractual relationships with various legal entities when
          you interact with our platform. Ride.Rent makes no warranties regarding
          the standard or quality of any product or service. Our promotional
          material is based on information provided by agents, sellers, third
          parties, suppliers, merchants, and affiliates. We collect payments from
          customers on behalf of these agents or service providers and send
          confirmation emails for the goods and services to be provided. Payments
          are processed using the agent’s preferred payment methods. Once the
          payment is made, it is the user’s responsibility to obtain a copy or
          receipt of the transaction. <br />
          <br /> If you wish to cancel a booking, you must notify the agent at
          least 24 hours before the scheduled time. A cancellation fee, as
          determined by the agent, will be deducted, and the balance will be
          refunded to the original mode of payment within 10 to 45 days, depending
          on the issuing bank. If you fail to notify the agent within the
          prescribed time limit, the entire amount will be charged, and no refund
          will be issued. <br />
          <br /> For most listed ads, we do not operate as a car rental or sales
          agency. Instead, we provide a service that allows agents to market their
          fleet/vehicles, and you to view vehicle details and other content hosted
          and developed by us. Agents are responsible for preparing the details
          and fielding inquiries directly from you. While we host these details in
          good faith, they are produced by agents and have not been verified by
          us. <br />
          <br /> You are responsible for conducting your own inquiries and
          research before making purchases, and we do not guarantee or accept
          responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any information
          contained within the details. <br />
          <br /> As the final customer, you are responsible for:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>
              Checking, confirming, and satisfying yourself with the accuracy of
              any details.
            </li>
            <li>
              Acting in good faith and ensuring that your actions align with the
              accuracy of any details before committing to any business
              transactions.
            </li>
