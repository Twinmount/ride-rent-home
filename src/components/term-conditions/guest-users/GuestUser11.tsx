          At Ride.Rent, we strive to ensure that our platform and services are
          accessible to you at all times. However, we cannot guarantee that the
          platform or services will operate continuously without interruptions or
          faults. Occasionally, necessary maintenance or upgrades may require us
          to make the platform and services temporarily unavailable without prior
          notice. We do our best to keep such downtime to a minimum. Please note
          that we accept no liability for any interruptions or loss of service.
          Furthermore, we reserve the absolute right to modify, suspend, or
          discontinue any part of our platform or services, including your access
          to them, at our discretion.
