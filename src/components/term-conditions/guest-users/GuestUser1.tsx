        Certain sections of the Platform may have additional terms of use. By

        additional terms of use. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for details

        Our Platform offers a wide range of services, including the arrangement
        of chauffeur services, and the rental of cars, sports cars, motorbikes,
        sports bikes, vans, buses, yachts, and aircraft charters. Additionally,
        we provide desert safari or recreational tour experiences, all
        facilitated through third-party suppliers. Ride.Rent operates as an
        intermediary platform, connecting users with these third-party service
        providers. We do not directly provide the travel, rental, or
        recreational tour experiences. <br />
        <br /> Ride.Rent Platform entirely works only as an intermediate and not
        as a transport, rental or a recreational service partner. It is the
        User’s responsibility to ensure that all information that they, or
        someone else on their behalf, have provided to Ride.Rent Platform is
        complete and accurate. <br />
        <br /> When you, as a guest user, contact an agent to rent a vehicle,
        our user interface will directly provide you with the agent&apos;s
        contact details or forward you to them. Rent.Drive reserves the right to
        make changes to the Platform at any time as deemed appropriate for
        enhancing and improving its quality for the Users. Additionally,
        Rent.Drive reserves the right to temporarily or permanently discontinue
        its services on the Platform, with or without prior notice to the Users,
        provided there is a valid reason. <br />
        <br /> Users can pay for their ride using a credit card or any other
        accepted payment method directly with the agent who listed the vehicle.
        Any transaction fees incurred when making payments made to agents, such
        as those due to currency conversion, will be the responsibility of the
        User. The price displayed on the Platform, as well as the currency of
        your residence, will be the same as the price and currency charged to
        your credit card.
